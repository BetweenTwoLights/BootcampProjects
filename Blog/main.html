<h2>This is my First Article</h2>

<blockquote>A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.</blockquote>

<p>We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now.</p>

<p>It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out.</p>

<h2>This is Another Article</h2>

<blockquote>Here we're limited by the time we have. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? You need the dark in order to show the light.</blockquote>

<p>I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself.</p>

<p>Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Let's have a happy little tree in here.</p>
